My journey to Data Analysts 

# Problem statement
What are sales by country per product  
What is the favourite product across all countries? 
Which country had more sales 
Which products was sold the most in Germany?

# Data sourcing
This sample dataset was downloaded here https://aka.ms/30DLDATFinanceDataSample  as the part of NG30 Days of Learning session. I also attached the excel file here. 

# Data transformation
The data was open on excel and examined for any errors or missing columns/raw. No errors were found. I was happy with data quality, therefore no transformation was done

# Findngs and recommendations
Data was analysed using excel, this was done by 
•	Open the finance data sample
•	Go to home
•	Go to analyse data tap
•	Click analyse data
•	Insert the required pivot tables and/or charts
